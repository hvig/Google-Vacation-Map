# Google-Vacation-Map
## Read Co-ordinates and plot my trip on google maps

## A few phases to the program

- Read locations from a file:  Excel, text, or some other source
- Plot them on a google map

- Start a trip
- Click on each destination
- Delete if you change your mind
- shortest path to drive to your locations
- get ETA drivng times??? might be last to get implemented
- save trip- use it for google maps.

## What am I doing new?

The entries will be stored in a text CSV file or an Excel file, so it is **SUPER EASY** to keep a list of target destinations on hand, add to them, yet no commit to visiting them until you are ready to plot your trip destinations.
